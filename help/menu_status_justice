[C:7:0:1]Dwarven Justice and You[C:7:0:0]
[B]
Many crimes are committed by dwarves throwing tantrums.  However, crimes can occur when you break a mandate.  When a mandate is broken, the
offended noble blames a related dwarf.  So if you fail to make metal goods, a metalsmith is charged with violation of a production order.  If you
export a prohibited item, the dwarf that brought it to the trade depot is charged.
[B]
Dwarven justice can be very harsh, especially if the offended noble has a high rank.  It is therefore very important to obey mandates given out
by the nobles, lest your prized metalsmith be subjected to five hammerstrikes.

[C:7:0:1]The Hammerer[C:7:0:0]
[B]
Hammering is the ultimate form of dwarven punishment.  The criminal is brought to a justice chain by the Hammerer and restrained.
The location of the hammerstrikes is calculated by the Hammerer, determined by an ancient formula.  Dwarves do not gather and spectate at such events.
[B]
Given such a sentence, death is not uncommon.  The Hammerer is not swayed by the
pleas of a friend or even his or her own spouse at the time of the punishment, although the Hammerer is not immune to later anguish and can sink into bitter depression.
[B]
Particularly egregious crimes are punished by execution.  Typically, an execution is a sentence of 50 to 100 hammerstrikes.  If the condemned dwarf somehow
survives, no further punishment is carried out and the dwarf can rejoin society to the extent that they are able.
[B]
This is never known to have occurred.
