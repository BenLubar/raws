[TITLE]The Manual:  Introduction[/TITLE]
Welcome to Dwarf Fortress.  Prepare to guide your stout charges to fortune in a world fraught with many perils.
You'll begin by creating your world and watching an animation of the region's history.  Once this process
is completed, you can prepare a group of dwarves and send them out to seek wealth deep in the mountains.
As you dig deeper and more dwarves take up residence in your outpost, your doings will attract attention, both
wanted and unwanted.  Deal with challenges as they arise, and you might one day find that your fortress
has grown to become the capital of the kingdom.
