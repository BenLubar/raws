[TITLE]The Manual:  Obtaining Water[/TITLE]
Your dwarves need to drink.  If they must, they can get their water from the river outside, but
you'll eventually learn to treat your dwarves with the respect that they deserve.  This involves
digging wells inside your fortress.  Once you've carved out some space, you'll need the components
for a well:
[B]
[C:6:0:1][CHAR:15][C:2:0:1] A healthy, unoccupied dwarf with a pick and the Mining profession
[B]
[C:6:0:1][CHAR:15][C:2:0:1] Stone blocks
[B]
[C:6:0:1][CHAR:15][C:2:0:1] A bucket
[C:7:0:0]
[B]

Once you've placed the well inside, your dwarves will begin to drink from it.  Four dwarves at a time can drink from a well,
so you might notice dwarves occasionally drinking from the river.  Create a few more wells to minimize this.

A well can also serve as the center of a meeting hall.  We'll discuss this in the Living Quarters section.

Eventually, you'll want to secure alcohol for your dwarves.  To do this, you need plants and a still.  We'll talk about how to operate
buildings like the still in the Making Crafts section, and in the Obtaining Food section we'll go over how to get plants.
