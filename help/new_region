[TITLE]The Manual:  Creating Your World[/TITLE]
When you start your first game, you'll notice that it goes through a lengthy world generation process.
You only have to do this once in a long while, so sit back and enjoy it.  It can take a while.
[B]
At first, the game produces
several fractally generated landscapes, searching for an ideal balance.  You'll notice that there are
many rejects, sometimes well over one hundred.  This is normal -- you'll be playing several fortresses
in this world, so it's important that terrain is evenly distributed.
[B]
After the basic terrain is prepared,
the game will simulate erosion and run rivers and lakes.  It's still possible to have a few rejects after at this point.

Once the history animation begins, you are watching the world you'll be playing in.  The civilizations
that are spreading out over the ages will be the same ones you interact with when you are running a fortress or playing an adventurer.
[B]
When history catches up with the present time, the animated world map becomes a piece of parchment and you are prompted to continue.
At this point, you'll have an option to export an image of your world (you can do this later from the Legends screen).  When you
decide to continue, the region will be exported to the disk (this also takes time).  Then you'll be back at the main menu, with new
play options.  Select Start Playing to begin.  Continue reading this manual for information on making a Dwarf Fortress.  Go to the Adventurer's Manual
for information on playing a single character.
