[C:7:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0]
[B]
Farming is the most reliable way to obtain food, but it is also the most complicated to prepare.
To get started, you must place a farm plot.  You can place a farm plot on soil or mud, inside or outside.
Dwarves with the Farming (Fields) profession will plant seeds according to your selections in the farm plot menu, and all dwarves help with the harvest.  A plant will generally grow either inside or outside, so be careful with the seeds you select.
[B]
Should you find a water source, you can divert the water using channels and floodgates to control
which squares become muddy (all water currently place mud).
[B]
Some plants that you farm aren't immediately edible, but can be processed at a mill or farmer's workshop to make
flour, sugar, syrup, spices or thread for cloth-making.
[B]
You can greatly increase your farm output by using potash as a fertilizer.
Potash is obtained from evaporating lye water, and lye water is obtained from soaking wood ash.  These jobs
are carried out at the Ashery.  The Making Crafts section of the First Outpost tutorial will discuss how to assign jobs.

[C:7:0:1]Preparing Food[C:7:0:0]
[B]
Each dwarf has preferred foods, but they only eat one piece of food when they are hungry.  In order to maximize the chance that a dwarf can find
a piece of food that they really enjoy, it is important to use a kitchen to prepare food.  This mixes the food types together.  It also allows a dwarven
cook the opportunity to apply their craft to the ingredients and produce higher quality foods.  The Making Crafts section of the First Outpost tutorial covers job assignment.
