[TITLE]The Manual: Your First Adventurer[/TITLE]
Before you begin, you need to create your adventurer.
[B]
First, you choose from among the available human, dwarf and elf civilizations or choose a retired adventurer once you have one.  New adventurers also pick a status from among peasant, hero and demigod.  The only effect of this status is to determine how powerful your character is at the beginning of the game.  The status will be indicated in your introduction in legends mode.
[B]
Second, you need to select attributes and skills to improve.  Among skills, most of the mental ones have no use in adventure mode currently, but kinesthetic sense and spatial sense can be used in combat.  Fighter and Observer are useful skills for combat.  Fighter influences your aiming chances greatly, relatively to your opponent's skill.  Your weapon skill will determine your starting equipment.  In the final screen you can select a name and gender for yourself.
[B]
Unless your world was somehow catastrophically depopulated, you should start in an appropriate settlement.  Feel free to explore, but in order to give yourself some direction, you can talk ([IKEY:A_TALK]) to people to get information and recruit followers.  The number and quality of the people that will join you depends on your overall skill and reputation.  You can ask people in town for numerous tasks at a time, though you might want to avoid this to reduce clutter in your log.  If somebody refers you elsewhere for a task, you can still ask for tasks again to obtain any additional tasks that person is interested in mentioning.
[B]
Once you are ready to go, you can press [IKEY:A_TRAVEL] (in friendly locations).  This takes you to the travel map, where you can move more quickly to your destination.  View your adventurer log ([IKEY:A_LOG]) to help you locate sites you know about or to remind you of your tasks.  You cannot enter certain sites from the travel map.  Stop travel ([IKEY:A_END_TRAVEL]) from the outskirts to approach these places carefully.
[B]
You'll need to eat and drink.  You start with some water, and you can refill your waterskin at a river or well.  Food is sold in town and you can also butcher animals that you kill in the wilderness.  It is important to stay well-rested, but it is dangerous to sleep outside, especially at night.  Travel with others or obtain permission to sleep in cottages or castles for the night.
[B]
If you cannot make use of the objects you find, remember that you can still sell them at towns and obtain more useful ones there.  There are many currencies in use in the world, and you may find that you have to trade in some types of coins as regular objects.  This devalues them significantly at this time.
[B]
Remember to check the key bindings to see a list of your options.  There are many commands that were not described here.
