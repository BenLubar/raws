[C:7:0:1]Description[C:7:0:0]
[B]
First you'll be confronted by a long list of buildings.  Many of these lead to submenus.  Choose the building you want by pressing the displayed hotkey or by selecting it with the cursor.
[B]
If you don't have the required materials, you will be told what you need.
[B]
Once you are ready to place a building, you'll see one or many Xs appear on the screen.  You can maneuver these in the same way as the standard cursor.
This is the location of your new building.  Some buildings have additional options for sizing and orientation.
[B]
The color of the Xs lets you know about the building placement:
[B]
[C:2:0:1]X[C:7:0:0] Legal placement[R]
[C:2:0:0]X[C:7:0:0] Legal placement and will obstruct dwarves[R]
[C:4:0:1]X[C:7:0:0] or [C:5:0:1]X[C:7:0:0] Blocked, cannot place[R]
The [C:4:0:1]X[C:7:0:0] can also appear in other special cases.  The reasons for placement failure are listed for you.
[B]
Once a building is placed, you'll be able to choose the objects you want to use from a list.  Some buildings require multiple items.
And of these, some buildings like bridges can be sized according to how many objects you select.  Other buildings like dirt roads do not require items.
[B]
When you've finished selecting items, healthy unoccupied dwarves with the appropriate professions will get to work on it.  Some buildings require an architect
to design them.  Some require a carpenter or mason, while others require a dwarf of the profession used by the building's tasks.
