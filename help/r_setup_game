[TITLE]The Manual: Preparing For The Expedition[/TITLE]
As before, there are three main screens.  However, you are now forced to select your location first.
Instructions for which keys to press are still displayed at the bottom of each screen.
[B]
The Site Selection Screen shows you which old fortress you'll be reclaiming, and the general characteristics of the surrounding area.  Depending
on how many fortresses you've created, you'll have one or many choices.
[B]
The Unit Preparation Screen has a list of the dwarves that are going on the expedition and their skills.
This time, you'll likely have more dwarves, but skill selection is easier.  You give each dwarf one military profession and one
craft profession.  The total number of each profession you are bringing along is on the right.  You don't spend any points here.
[B]
You buy skills with points.  Keep in mind that the skill list scrolls.
The amount of points you have is displayed on the lower right.
These points are also used to buy equipment on the Equipment Preparation Screen.
[B]
The Equipment Preparation Screen is the most complicated of the three screens (but it's the same as before).  The list of objects your dwarves are bringing along appears on the left, and the list of animals going on the journey appears on the right.  If you choose to add a new object, you'll be taken to a screen with a list of all the potential items that you can bring.  Type in a partial name to narrow the list.
You can leave this screen by selecting an object or by pressing [IKEY:LEAVESCREEN_TEXT].
