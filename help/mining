Mining serves two purposes.  First, you get minerals which you can turn into treasure.  Second, you
create living space for your dwarves to shelter in.  The rest of the First Outpost tutorial
will guide you through how to create living spaces, how to make crafts and how to store the minerals
and crafts that come under your control.
