accounts
[TITLE]The Manual:  Accounts[/TITLE]
Once you get a manager and a bookkeeper, your dwarves will all be given accounts in the currency of the dwarven kingdom.
[B]
They can no longer freely acquire goods, or even food, but instead must purchase these things.  The only exception is that penniless starving
dwarves can eat the cheapest food items in the fortress.
[B]
Nobles do not have accounts.  Dwarves that have attained a legendary skill status are also exempt.
[B]
Other dwarves must obtain money by doing tasks or running shops.
[B][B]
[C:7:0:1]Coins[C:7:0:0]
[B]
Once accounts are active, dwarves will want shiny coins to reflect their balances.  The bookkeeper sets mandates that let you know how many coins to make.
These mandates are exceptional in that there are no punishments associated to them.  Dwarves will periodically bring coins to their rooms or give
up coins if they have too many.
[B][B]
[C:7:0:1]Shops[C:7:0:0]
[B]
In order to sell goods to your dwarves, you'll have to set up shops.  Initially, shops are run by the bookkeeper and broker, but these dwarves
will attempt to sell the stops off to any willing buyer.
[B]
The shopkeeper buys finished goods from the fortress stockpiles and has them moved to the stop to be sold to other dwarves at a slight profit.
[B]
All purchases occur at the account level.  Coins are not needed.  The bookkeeper handles all of the accounting.  All dwarves have exceptional
abilities with coin counting and seem to know the balances of every dwarf in the fortress, so there are no attempts to cheat the shopkeeper.
[B]
The power of Dwarven Justice dissuades potential thieves.
