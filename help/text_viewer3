[TITLE]The Manual:  Helpless or Hopeless?[/TITLE]
You have pressed the help key many times.
You only need to press the help key once, no matter how urgent your problem may seem at the time.
Press [IKEY:LEAVESCREEN] to go back to the previous screen.
Despite my promise to have the help key work on any screen, it doesn't work on this screen.
If you are having technical trouble, go to www[.]bay12games[.]com and ask for help on the forums.
[HELP:NO_FILE]
