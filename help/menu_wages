You can view wages from this screen.

Use [IKEY:STANDARDSCROLL_LEFT] and [IKEY:STANDARDSCROLL_RIGHT] to switch screens.

The percentages on the first screen are general guild modifiers.  These are not applied to the wage numbers in subsequent screens.
So if mining is displayed as "[C:3:0:1]5[CHAR:15][C:7:0:0]" and the mining modifier is set at "[C:3:0:1]200%[C:7:0:0]", mining is actually worth [C:3:0:1]10[CHAR:15][C:7:0:0].
