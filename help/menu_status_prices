Use [IKEY:STANDARDSCROLL_UP][IKEY:STANDARDSCROLL_DOWN][IKEY:STANDARDSCROLL_PAGEUP][IKEY:STANDARDSCROLL_PAGEDOWN] to scroll.

Prices are displayed as a percentage.  These are originally set by the bookkeeper corresponding to item availability, but occasionally nobles
will tweak prices to make objects they like harder for peasants to buy.  Produce more of an object or material to make it cheaper.

If no prices are displayed for a given object type, this means that the prices are all at standard levels, or the object is completely unavailable for purchase.
[B]
You can view an individual items price by viewing its description (from the Stocks screen for instance).
