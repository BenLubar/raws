[TITLE]The Manual:  Trading[/TITLE]
Sometimes your dwarves need to trade away their wealth to obtain necessities.  You do this at a trade depot.
Merchants arrive throughout the year, starting in the first autumn.

You can go to the trade depot both to designate goods to be brought to the depot for trade and to perform
the actual transactions.

Humans require a road to bring their wagons.  The road must be able to support a 3x3 wagon all
the way to the center of the depot.  Road placement leaves holes where there are rocks.  You must detail these rocks, including the stone
floor if your depot is inside.
Bridges over the river count as a road.  Clear trees in advance.  You will know that your road is successful when it
fades three wide off the left edge of the map for several tiles.  Humans will bring mules even if no wagons can access your fortress.
