[B]
Doors have three major settings.
[B]
You can set a door as locked.  This does not mean it is locked in that it won't stop invaders, but it means your dwarves are forbidden from using it.
[B]
You can set a door to be kept ajar.  This means that your pets and invaders can use the door freely.
[B]
A door can also be set as internal.  This means that the door will not stop the room plan from flowing through during room creation.
[B]
Doors can be taken by invaders.  This stops you from controlling the door.  To retake a door, one of your dwarves must walk through it.
