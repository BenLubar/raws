[C:7:0:1]Description[C:7:0:0]
[B]
An activity zone is an area where your dwarves perform any of a variety of tasks.  Sometimes the dwarves will perform these tasks on their own and the activity zone is a way of localizing activity, and sometimes the activity zone is the only way to get the dwarves to perform the task.
[B]
First you need to place an activity zone.  This is done by selecting two of its opposing corners with your cursor.
As you move to the second corner, you will be shown a count of how many of the squares in the rectangle are valid for a given activity.

You can drop creatures into these zones.  You can also designate them to be filled with buckets.  Once an animal is dropped, it loses its attachment to the zone, so if it gets out somehow your dwarves will not seek to replace it.
