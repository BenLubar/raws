[TITLE]The Manual:  Reclaim Outpost Introduction[/TITLE]
Welcome to Dwarf Fortress.  Your old fortress.  Things didn't go well, and now you're back to set the record straight or die trying.
I wonder which it will be[.][.].  In any case, the game runs in the same way, except there is a pre-carved and pre-populated outpost
waiting for you.
[B]
You'll have a large expeditionary force, fully armed and ready to go.  Once you clear out a few rooms, you can start relieving some
of your soldiers.  You'll notice that they do not interact with the objects in the fortress at first.  This is to prevent accidents.
The last thing you want is for your dwarves to run alone to fetch something deep in enemy territory.
[B]
In order to let your dwarves know where to go, use the new Reclaim designation.  When you select it, you'll notice that many of
the items on the screen turn green.  These are objects which are currently being ignored.  They'll also be surrounded by {}.
[B]
The only other difference is in setting up your expedition.  You should also read that section of this manual.
