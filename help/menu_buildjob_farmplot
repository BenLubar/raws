[B]
Here you can select which crop to plant in the farm plot each season.
There is no reason to let a field stand fallow, since the mud is refreshed each year.
Prepare multiple plots to plant more than one crop type.
[B]
If a crop is red, it is known that this is a bad time of the season to plant it, or the season you have selected has already passed.
[B]
Potash is the fertilizer of choice for dwarves.  It is made from lye in the Ashery.  Lye is made from ash,
which you obtain at the wood furnace.  You'll need barrels and buckets to handle lye.
[B]
The [C:7:0:1]Ft 0/3[C:7:0:0] indicator at the bottom left of the menu tells you how fertilized your field is.
The closer you get to full fertilization, the more plants can be produced from a single square.  If you don't
fertilize fields, you will get one plant per square (though plants can sometimes yield multiple seeds, for a net gain).
[B]
You can make your dwarves fertilize the field by pressing [IKEY:BUILDJOB_FARM_FERTILIZE].  This will schedule enough jobs to fertilize your field.  If you press [IKEY:BUILDJOB_FARM_SEASFERT], these jobs will schedule at the beginning of each future season at this plot.
