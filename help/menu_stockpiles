When you get to the stockpile menu, you'll be faced by several stockpile options.  Each of these stockpile
types holds different kinds of objects.
[B]
To place a stockpile, press [IKEY:SELECT] to designate one corner, move the cursor, and press [IKEY:SELECT] again to finish.
Stockpiles are denoted by [C:0:0:1]=[C:7:0:0].  You can only have one type of stockpile per square, and they cannot be placed on buildings.

[C:7:0:1]Mining Stockpile[C:7:0:0]
[B]
A mining stockpile holds both ore and stone.  It can be a convenient way to clear out tunnels.  Then you can set up a stone pile near your mason
and an ore pile near your smelter, and set these piles to take from the mining pile to create a flow of stone and ore.
[B][B]
[C:7:0:1]Refuse Stockpile[C:7:0:0]
[B]
This holds anything inedible that can rot, as well as tattered clothing, bones and shells.
It's important to get refuse above ground before it starts to stink and bother your dwarves.
You'll notice purple clouds in your cave if something is rotting indoors.

[C:7:0:1]Animal Stockpile[C:7:0:0]
[B]
This holds live animals in cages, not butchered animals.  Meat goes to the food pile.
