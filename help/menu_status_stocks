There are two modes.  One compresses the item list for convenience, and one displays the items individually in a list.  When you are in
the individual list, you can view an object's description or zoom to its location on the map.  You can also designate metal items
to be melted down here.  Once you designate an object, you need to place a melting job at a smelter.
