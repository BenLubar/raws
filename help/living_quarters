[TITLE]The Manual:  Living Quarters[/TITLE]
Your dwarves don't like to sleep and eat outside in the mud and rain, so you'll like to set up some
living quarters early on.

[C:7:0:1]Sleeping Quarters[C:7:0:0]
[B]
If you build some beds and place them, the dwarves will sleep in them when they are tired.  If you use the building interface
to creating a bedroom, then the first dwarf to sleep in the room will claim it unless you assign a dwarf first.  The better the room,
the happier the dwarf, but regular workers don't expect much.  Keep your eyes on their thoughts to see how you are doing.

[C:7:0:1]Dining Rooms[C:7:0:0]
[B]
A dwarf expects a decent dining experience.  To keep the dwarves satisfied the bare minimum is a table with an adjacent chair.  You'll
know that you are doing this correctly because the dwarf will sit on the chair and you'll see the dwarf's meal placed on the table.  Dragging out
a dining room from the table will enhance the dining experience, but it is not required.

[C:7:0:1]Meeting Halls[C:7:0:0]
[B]
Another way to keep dwarves happy is to give them places to meet and hold social events.  Meeting halls work well for this purpose.  You can
drag out a meeting hall from a well or a table.  Note that a room dragged out from a table will be a dining room unless you specifically designate it a
meeting hall.

[C:7:0:1]Other Rooms[C:7:0:0]
[B]
You can also drag out rooms from statues, cages and chains.  This will create sculpture gardens or zoos, respectively.  You can assign
these rooms to specific dwarves, or you can leave them as general meeting places.
