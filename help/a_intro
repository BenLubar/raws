[TITLE]The Manual: Adventure Mode Introduction[/TITLE]
Maybe you attempted to guide the dwarves to fortune and things just didn't work out?
Welcome to adventure mode.  Now you'll create a character and go on a journey of
discovery throughout the world your dwarves left behind.  Perhaps you'll set out for
the ruins of your old fortress or help a nearby town.  Throughout the course
of your explorations, you'll not only build your own legend, but unearth tales of
ancient heroes and fallen civilizations (possibly your own).  Whether you are in it for personal glory,
or so that the legend of your dwarf fortress can be exposed to the scrutiny of history, you'll
find what you're looking for...  or die trying several times.

Note:  Your adventure will begin a few weeks after the fall of your last fortress.
If you start another fortress, it will begin in the Spring of the following year.
