Change this to turn sound off.

[SOUND:ON]

Change this to skip the wonderful intro movies.

[INTRO:ON]

This is the size and font for windowed mode.  Changing to 800x600 and the 800x600 font might make you happier.

If you don't like the ,.`' ground, try setting this to NO.  The ground will turn into periods only.

[VARIED_GROUND_TILES:YES]

If you turn this off, you'll see some atrocious 128 character mode crap.  I didn't try hard on the map for it, or at all.

[EXTENDED_ASCII:YES]

This controls the number of milliseconds that must pass before a held key sends a repeat press to the game.  You might need to adjust this.

[KEY_HOLD_MS:150]

This controls "more" in adventure mode.  If MORE is set to NO, all announcements will be skipped.  DISPLAY_LENGTH controls how many lines are printed before it gives you the "more" prompt.

[MORE:YES]
[DISPLAY_LENGTH:23]

These are the display colors in RGB.  The game is actually displaying extended ASCII characters in OpenGL, so you can modify the colors.
