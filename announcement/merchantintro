[TITLE]The Autumn Caravan[/TITLE]
[P]Although it is a grim reminder of the winter hardships to come,
the supply caravan from [VAR:NATIVENAME:GLOBAL:YOURCIV] is a welcome sight.
As the merchants unload their goods at the depot,
you notice with pride that their eyes are alight with
the anticipation of inspecting
the splendid products of your industrious craftsdwarves.
Take careful stock of your own stores.  What these dwarves offer
might very well be the difference between a prosperous future and
a slow and meaningless death.
