[VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  What a pleasant surprise!  Not a single tree here weeps from the abuses
meted out with such ease by your people.  Joy!  The dwarves have turned a page,
not that we would make paper.  A travesty!  Perhaps it is better said that the dwarves
have turned over a new leaf, and the springtime for our two races has
only just begun.
